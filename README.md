1. Education & Skills
   Idea: A platform that connects students and unemployed youth with free online courses, mentorships, and resources to develop job-ready skills.
   Why: Education and skills development is critical for employability, especially for young people in underserved communities.
   - **Implementation**: Use Django to create a portal where users can view and enroll in curated courses, and include a recommendation system to match learners with suitable courses based on their interests and skill levels.

### 2. **Financial Inclusion**
   - **Idea**: Develop a mobile app for micro-savings and financial literacy aimed at the unbanked population, with simplified features for easy use.
   - **Why**: Financial inclusion is key to reducing poverty, and digital tools can greatly improve access.
   - **Implementation**: Create a simple interface to facilitate savings groups, track financial goals, and offer basic financial education modules.

### 3. **Health & Wellbeing**
   - **Idea**: A mobile-based mental health support platform that provides access to basic mental health resources, daily self-care tips, and connections to counselors.
   - **Why**: Mental health services are often limited in many communities, and digital tools can bridge the gap.
   - **Implementation**: Focus on building a resource library with articles, exercises, and options for online counseling sessions. 

### 4. **Clean Water & Sanitation**
   - **Idea**: A community-led reporting and monitoring app for clean water sources, allowing users to report issues with water supply or quality.
   - **Why**: Access to clean water remains a challenge in many rural areas, and community-based monitoring can help manage resources.
   - **Implementation**: Build a simple app with Django for users to report water issues and track the status of water sources in their area.

### 5. **Youth Empowerment**
   - **Idea**: A youth empowerment platform with resources for leadership development, volunteer opportunities, and peer mentorship.
   - **Why**: Empowering young people supports long-term societal impact, especially in areas like leadership and community involvement.
   - **Implementation**: Use Django and JavaScript to build a dynamic platform where users can register, find opportunities, and connect with mentors.
